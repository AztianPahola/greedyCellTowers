# Problem Statement
Consider a country with long roads and houses along the road. Assume that the residents of all houses use cell phones. We want to place cell phone towers along the road, and each cell phone tower covers a range of 9 miles. Create a greedy algorithm that allows the fewest cell phone towers. Additionally, create a brute force algorithm to complete the same problem and compare the results and efficiency.

Your program should output the number of towers needed and the location of each tower.

# Solution Summary
Input: int[] x ; array of houses
Output: int[] y ; array of cell towers
